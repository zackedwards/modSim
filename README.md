Reflection
Design
What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
The most helpful part about creating design methods for this project was that we always had something to reference when we were unsure what to do next or how a component should interface with the system.
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
The most difficult part was anticipating what we would need to do in order to accomplish the task and how the end product would look. If I could go back I would do more research before starting the designs because it would have enabled me to do it more efficiently and accurately.
What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I found source control and the tool github for collaboration and source control to be extremely useful. I had to make use of it in several projects this year and even had to revert my code base to an earlier commit on one project which saved me an unthinkable amount of time and effort. I will definitely be using it in future projects. 
Implementation
What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
For implementing, we found the umlet models to be extremely helpful for thinking out and planning our project. When we went to implement it, most of the planning was already done and we just had to put it into action. This also made it easier to split up the work. In terms of testing, we found the concept of mocking to be extremely powerful because it allowed us to test our api without using up calls. In terms of integration we found that the use of github for collaboration and integration was extremely useful. It allowed us to merge our code and review the changes that were being made. 
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
The hardest part about implementing and testing our project for me was getting the api to connect properly. It had a limited number of calls we could perform and setting it up requires some tinkering. I did not want to perform unnecessary api calls so I had to use a mock to replace the api call in my unit test. This allowed me to test the api properly. It was relatively difficult to implement but it was necessary and saved us from overusing the api. 
What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project
Once again, I found that github was an unbelievably powerful tool for integration and I will be using it on every project I ever am a part of from now on. I also found automated test cases to be a great tool and will be using that again in the future, either through travis ci or another platform.
Process
What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
Kanban was a great way for my team to organize our thoughts and plans. We used our initial requirements to create the tasks on our kanban board and anytime one of us had an extra idea or found a bug, we would add it there for the rest of the team to see. This helped us stay on track and organized as we had transparency into the progress of the rest of the team. We used code reviews successfully as well, meeting before and after sprints to go over what we had done and prepare for what came next. I found these meetings to be a useful structure for our team to follow because it gave us a time to voice our concerns and measure our progress. 
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
One difficulty was that if someone on our team did not keep track of their task and move it from in progress to complete, then it would look like that still needed to be done and would confuse us. If I could go back and try it differently I would put one team member in charge of the kanban board and have team members report progress to that person. That way one person can maintain the board and the progress would be there for everyone to see.
What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
It was difficult to remember to check the kanban board often and move tasks once they were completed, but as I got more into it I found this practice extremely satisfying and implemented it on other projects I did this semester.
 
 
Overall
Most of the practices we learned require the team to step back and plan, or do some thought out process such as integration. It takes time and effort away from coding, but decreases the chance that the team will need to refactor things later. They all also reduce the amount of bugs you can expect to experience. When combined these methods will organize the team and create a more agile workflow. Overall I found the methods that I have learned in models and simulation to be useful and time saving, and will be employing them in the future. Coding without a plan in mind or working on separate branches without integrating, or coding with testing are all very negative practices which will result in bugs and errors. If you do these for too long without reviewing, you may need to completely refactor the project in order to make it work which takes way more time and effort than just planning it out in the first place and using careful organized approaches to collaboration and testing.
